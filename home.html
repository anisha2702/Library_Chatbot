    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      The Library Chatbot is an intelligent assistant designed to help users easily find books in the library.
      It provides book recommendations based on categories and lets users know exactly where a book is located â€” including section, shelf, and row.

    <p class="text-gray-700">
      Built using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, it fetches live book data from a JSON file and supports filtering by genres and availability.
